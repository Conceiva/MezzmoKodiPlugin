<b>Why Mezzmo ?</b>

Kodi, with its huge addon community, has a ton of functionality and there are a number of other popular media sharing solutions, so why Mezzmo and the Mezzmo Kodi addon ?

While both statements are true they highlight the challenges today for many Kodi users. Many users start out enjoying the capabilities of Kodi and sometimes other sharing solutions only to find themselves spending more and more time managing the complexities that have built up over time. These complexities are often the many Kodi addons, metadata scraping challenges, software upgrade driven issues, media / file sharing challenges and limitations of various SMB, file structures and difficult XML file configurations, complex SQL / database setups and other complexities. Other popular Kodi library sharing solutions often cause their own set of complexities or force their users to sacrifice certain functionality. Other UPnP/DLNA sharing solutions have multiple addons that you must choose from depending upon whether you want their interface or Kodi native. With the Mezzmo Kodi addon you get both simultaneously in a single addon.

The Mezzmo Kodi addon was designed to simplify the Kodi experience, maximize the features available, give you your time back to enjoy watching your media and automate as much as possible. Kodi is a great media client and a goal of the Mezzmo Kodi addon is to make it even better. Many Mezzmo users often find themselves no longer spending nearly so much of their time maintaining Kodi, Kodi addons or their Kodi databases. The challenges of dealing with Kodi's various scrapers, trying to rescrape or change individual metadata items and more can be very frustrating. Kodi instances leveraging Mezzmo are typically far more stable as many of the administrative functions are moved to and managed by Mezzmo, leaving the Kodi clients to be more efficient and much less complex. In Kodi environments where multiple clients are involved the value is even greater since, with Mezzmo, you can <a href="https://github.com/Conceiva/MezzmoKodiPlugin/wiki/How-it-works-%3F#managing-sharing">centrally manage</a> what your clients see and not spend time trying to manage each client. The Mezzmo Kodi addon works with all Kodi skins and has some features which may help overcome limitations with some skins.

Mezzmo will also grow with you as your needs increase. Whether you want superior <a href="https://github.com/Conceiva/MezzmoKodiPlugin/wiki/Managing-Your-Library">library management</a> tools, share your library across multiple Kodi and non-Kodi clients, host all forms of media, add parental controls and more, Mezzmo has the solution for you. See <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/features.asp">here</a> for a complete set of Mezzmo features.

If you are ready to fully enjoy Kodi the easy way, then Mezzmo is probably the solution for you.
