<b>Overview</b>

<a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/default.asp">Mezzmo Windows </a>is a powerful and flexible media server that lets you stream all your media (videos, music and photos) to your devices and web browsers inside your home and outside your home. Install it onto your PC or laptops and start streaming all your files in minutes!

With Mezzmo and Kodi together, Mezzmo is a centralized UPnP server which maintains your media libraries in one location but provides a powerful set of tools for metadata scraping, full customization of what each client sees, custom playlists with advanced query tools, full sharing of play counters, bookmarks (resume pointers) and similar with a full set of GUI based tools for easily maintaining your libraries. Unlike many other UPnP solutions Mezzmo has full metadata support with Kodi. This is one of many features which sets it apart from the others. Additional features include full subtitle support, preferred audio stream settings, trailers, web based access, support for live streaming, integrated radio station addons, H.265/HEVC 4K support and more. These features are all part of Mezzmo. For additional information, <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/features.asp">click here. </a>

With the Mezzmo Kodi addon there is full integration into Kodi and <a href="https://github.com/Conceiva/MezzmoKodiPlugin/wiki/Native-Kodi-Access">its skins</a>, database and features. The addon will automatically sync Kodi's database to Mezzmo in the background. You no longer need to worry about messing with the Kodi database. It's all taken care of for you. If you need to build a new client or start over with an existing client, just install Kodi, then the Mezzmo addon and everything else is automatic. Discovery of new media is automatic in Mezzmo with a full set of customization features for managing the metadata in your library.
